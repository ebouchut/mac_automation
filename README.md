# mac_automation

This is where I put scripts I use to **automate workflows on my Mac** 
in [Keyboard Meastro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) 
and [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/).

With regards to the scripts, credit goes to their original authors, 
because  as of now I only dabble with Applescript and use scripts 
that make the job done.

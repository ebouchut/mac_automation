# mac_automation

This is where I put scripts I use to **automate workflows on my Mac**.
I use them in [Keyboard Meastro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) and [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/).

With regards to the scripts I use, credit goes to their original authors, because  as of now
I only dabble with Applescript and grab fine scripts that make the job done.

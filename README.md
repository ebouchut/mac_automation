# mac_automation

This is where I put scripts I use to **automate workflows on my Mac** 
in [Keyboard Meastro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) 
and [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/).

With regards to the scripts, credit goes to their original authors, 
because  as of now I only dabble with Applescript and use scripts 
that make the job done.

## Typing ⌘K in System Preferences Opens the App Keyboard Shortcuts

In **`BetterTouchTool`**, 
for the **`System Preferences`** App, 
create the **`Keyboard Shortcut`**  `⌘K` 
that runs [this AppleScript](system/system_preferences/system_preferences_app_shortcuts.scpt)
